<b> Myers-Briggs personality test </B></br>
</br>
</br>

 

 

 

 

 

 

According to this test result my personality type is Defender also called Nurturer. It totally relates to the person I am. It means I can be a very good team member as these types of personalities are very reliable and dedicated. These people can create a very positive work environment because of their kind nature. They have good analytical abilities though they are reserved still they have impressive social skills. They are open to new ideas and experiences. They have a natural desire to do good that’s why fields like counseling, charity, medicine, academics social work is desirable for this type of people. Their kind and selfless nature can sometimes be a drawback for them as people tend to take them for granted as they have hard time saying no to others which can lead to stress. They are at their best in a harmonious, well organized, calm and slow-paced work environment, and feel motivated if tasks are clearly defined. 

They have good listening skills are warm and approachable in the role of manager. They have high tendency towards problem solving and conflict management as they are conflict averse. They are not assertive in fact they like to work side by side with their team and subordinates which help them develop a positive relationship with them. They are always available to help wherever and whenever possible 

 

</br>
</br>
<b>The following qualities of Defenders can be extremely beneficial for team work: </b>
</br>
</br>
Loyal and dedicated 

Reliable and consistent 

Responsible 

Imaginative and observant (makes them creative and give attention to details)

 </br>
 </br>
 </br>
<b>Learning style Test </b>

 </br>

 </br>

According to this test I am a visual learner. Visual learners respond well to visual stimulus or learning material like images, graphs, pictures, shapes, symbols, flowcharts 

They notice small details. They are good planners, decision makers. They day dream a lot and have strong imagination. They understand any project as a whole. They have a good memory and sense of direction. They have good research and problem-solving skills. They are very well organized, has great sense of balance and alignment. They are good at following directions and mind mapping. 

I totally agree with this test result as I find it hard to concentrate for long when something is said without visual aids. I retain knowledge gained through visuals longer.

<b>Big Five Personality Test </b> 
</br>
</br>
 

 

Interpretation and impact on team work 

According to the results of this test I scored the highest on factor III I.e., agreeability which depicts that I am friendly and optimistic person. For a good team member, it is extremely important to be friendly and easy going plus optimism can always help keep the moral of the group high. Which shows I can be a good addition to any team or group I work with.  

Factor IV and V are also high enough which means I will be one of the responsible and careful members of the team. Which can help reduce the risk of mistakes and will help keep things on track and organized which is very essential for any team to achieve their goals and objectives effectively and efficiently. I tend to be open to new experiences which can help in the creative part of tasks assigned to any team. 

On the other hand, I scored lesser on Factor I and II. Which means I need to be more emotionally stable to deal with any conflict arising in the group so that my performance won’t be affected. I also tend to be an introvert which again can be a drawback for working in a group as this trait reduce one's chances of instant bonding with other team members. 

I agree with most of the test results
