  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <p> 

 

 

<b>Overview of the app  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 

My project idea is based upon creating an app for emergency services reporting which consist of few steps for easy and quick reporting.  The project idea perfectly aligns with my personality type according Myers-Briggs personality test which is a “defender” as the app is a tool providing services to safety and security industry. The main purpose of the app is its accessibility and providing firsthand information to the end user within shortest period of time. Due to its simple and easy interface, it will serve the largest age group from child to old age users. I think it can be more productive than the traditional methods like phone reporting or in some cases reporting an incident or crime on website which can be sometimes be lengthy and complex. Strength of the app lies in its uniqueness and design, no such types of apps are available in market according to my research. It can completely revolutionize the way we report crime or incident. A study shows an average person xxx hours using mobile phone on daily basis and another research shows people using social apps for friend's vs calling friends is xxx, relating to this trend there is highly probability of people reporting crime / incident will be higher on app as compared to conventional methods of calling or web browser based online reporting.  

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Motivation for the project idea </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 

The motivation for the project idea based upon two main factors firstly my family historic services in military and defense forces during Yousafzai state of swat era and later on in royal British armed forces secondly my personal interest in IT field. I always have the passion of doing good for the people and helping the community. I have done number of social and community works in my hometown since childhood. I was a leading organizer for a charity work to financially help the victims of 2005 deadly earthquake in Swat area which killed around 75,000 people. I also organized other charity works during other natural disasters including the 2010 flooding’s in my area that killed 2000 people. As a defender by personality according to Myers Briggs personality test, I always have the passion to help community in one way or another but now using my IT skill for the creation of this app will be the continuation of my social and community services.

<b> Description </b>

 <br/>



<br/>
<br/>
<b>Features of the app </b>

 <br/>
 <br/>

It is going to be a unique app with which one can report any emergency situation/ incident in seconds with only 4 instant taps using your smartphone IOS / Android. It is going to be different than the other conventional methods of reaching out to emergency departments as It will provide evidence of the incident on the spot in the form of image, video or audio clip. It can give an clear and detailed information of the situation. In some situations, calling the cops can get the person in trouble making a video, taking picture or recording audio clip would reduce the risk of being overheard by the culprit. The location can be automatically shared which will save time and damage can be minimized. It will have super user friendly and simple interface so that the user doesn’t get stuck in complications. This app is going to be different as it can be used to report all types of incidents in one app unlike Emergency+, Fires near me etc. 

It will also have the option of hiding the identity of reporting person as many crimes are not reported because of the fear identity disclosure. They don’t have to go anywhere to report it. Which are some of the main reasons people don’t report crime. Help provide first hand visual or audio for best response and times. 

It will work in online mode (photo and videos included) or offline mode (no video or photo included only for quick sending I.e., the text only report) where there are limited signals.

<b>Skills required </b>
<br/>
<br/>List of skills required for App creation 
<br/>
<br/>

Quality User Interface design 
<br/>
<br/>
Java Programming 
<br/>
<br/>
Cross platform App Development knowledge 
<br/>
<br/>
App security  
<br/>
<br/>
Git: Version Control System 

 
<br/>

<br/>
 

<b>Software to be used </b>
<br/>
<br/>
Software required for this app creation would be MIT app inventor, java, SQL, html and C++. Different section of the app would require different software and tools. For graphical or interface of the app I will use MIT app inventor and java. Java and C++ programming languages would be used to define functions of operations of the app e g sending data to other devices etc. SQL would be used to parts of app that need communication with database e.g., storing or retrieving of data and information. 
<br/>
 <br/>

<b>Outcome </b>
